# File for ideas

Potential Softwares to Use:
- Unity (MUST)
- Aseprite
- Pyxel Edit


Environment Description:

Could potentially be a slum, run down, dark colour scheme, shit on fire, etc...

On Death:

when the player dies they are sent to the 'back rooms'.
they have to escape the backrooms in a set amount of time otherwise they restart from the start of the game (maybe)

Potential Features:

- Broken / Worn tiles that could crumble when Joe steps on them. This will drop Joe into the backrooms.
- Joe has a small amount of time to escape the Backrooms before he dies to an unknown entity.
- Joe can find and use Monster on the floor in the Backrooms (Randomly Generated) to run faster for a short period of time.
- The Backrooms are generated randomly so there is no specific pattern or path the user can follow to escape quicker each time. New escape and exit every time. 



STORY PLAN: 

joe wakes up in the house, is hungover and complains
Joe wakes up by the front door. The front door is locked, he cannot leave through the front door. The bathroom door is also locked and useless. 
Joe has no choice but to walk through into the dining room / kitchen. In the kitchen Joe finds Callum sat at the head of the Table.
Joe interacts with Callum. Callum then gives a request for marmite at the store. Joe is then given the front door key to leave the house and make his way to the store.

<-----Space for new characters on the way to the store----->

Joe arrives at the store and ventures through the store looking for the marmite Callum requested.
<-----Space for Dylan to be found within the store, probably in a sweet aisle----->
Joe finds the marmite and makes his way out of the store. Joe walks back to the house

<-----Space for new characters on the way back from the store----->

Joe gets back from the store, Callum is wasted out of his fucking face. Empty bottles of alcohol everywhere. 
Callum requests marmite on toast. Joe has to put bread in the toaster, get the toast out when its toasted, butter it, and spread marmite on the toast.
Once Joe has made the toast, he hands the toast to Callum. Callum starts flashing like a white beacon, rapidly until he turns into a white beam that disappears.
Callum has now disappeared and under where he was sat in the basement key. Joe picks up the key and he can now access the basement.
